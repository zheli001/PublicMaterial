# Sarah's Quick Guide to Story Writing

Follow these steps whenever you sit down to write.

## 1. Setup
*   **Check Branch**: Make sure you are on `story` or `loney_coder` branch.
*   **Open Folder**: Navigate to `tmp/[your_story_name]/`.

## 2. The Writing Loop
1.  **Draft**: Open `current.txt`. Write your scene or chapter.
2.  **Score**: In Antigravity, type: `Score my current.txt`.
3.  **Refine**: 
    - Read the `score.md` or chat feedback.
    - Focus on the **Aesthetics** and **Theme** suggestions.
    - Edit `current.txt` to improve.
4.  **Loop**: Repeat step 2 & 3 until you are happy (aim for 7.5+ score).
5.  **Finish**: Type `done` in Antigravity to archive this version.

## 3. Formatting
*   Use `chapter_template.md` to format your final chapter.
*   Ensure you have the navigation titles (TOC | Prev | Next).

## 4. Publishing
When a chapter is ready for the world:
1.  Type: `Publish story [your_story_name]`
2.  Antigravity will move it to the `story/` folder and push to the `main` branch.

## 5. Helping the AI Remember
*   **The "Memory Bridge"**: If your chat gets long, the AI might forget character details.
*   **Periodic Reminders**: Every 20 minutes, send a quick: "Reminder: We are writing [Story Name], Sarah is [Personality], the Tone is [Mood]."
*   **Start Fresh/Summarize**: If the AI seems confused, ask: "Can you summarize our current progress so far?" This refreshes its immediate context.

## 6. Pro Tips
*   **Ask for Brainstorming**: "Can you help me brainstorm a dialogue for this scene?"
*   **Ask for Description**: "How can I make this room feel more oppressive?"
*   **Snapshot Often**: Every `done` command is a safety net. Don't be afraid to experiment!
