# Solutions — Phase3 / Lesson4: Dividend Sustainability Check

Model solution example:
- Dividend yield = AnnualDividend / Price. Example: AnnualDividend = $1.20, Price = $30 → Yield = 4.0%.
- Payout ratio = Dividends / NetIncome (or Dividends per Share / EPS). Example: Payout = 60% → medium sustainability; check cash flow.

Example assessment (2 lines):
- Yield 4.0% with payout 60% and stable operating cash flow suggests moderate sustainability; monitor earnings volatility.
