# Solutions & Model Answers — What is a Stock

Author: Jeff Li
Date: 2025-10-25

Purpose: Model one-line definitions, sample company responses, common mistakes, and the grading rubric for the learner-facing assignment.

---

## Model one-line definitions (examples)
- "A stock is a fractional ownership share in a company." — Good (concise, accurate)
- "A stock gives the holder an ownership stake and possible claim on profits and assets." — Good (slightly longer)
- Incorrect / unclear: "A stock is a thing you buy for profit." (Too vague — lacks ownership/rights description)

## Sample company response (AAPL)
- One-sentence definition: "Apple's stock represents fractional ownership of Apple Inc., entitling shareholders to potential dividends and voting rights." (Sample)
- Two shareholder rights observed: 1) Voting on corporate matters (common shares), 2) Right to dividends (if declared by board).
- Dividend status: Apple pays dividends. Last dividend: [example date placeholder] (source: Yahoo Finance — https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/). Replace with current date when grading.
- Market cap calculation (optional): Price $P × Shares outstanding = Market Cap (show calculation with current numbers when grading).

## Common mistakes & instructor hints
- Mistake: Confusing dividend with guaranteed cash — note dividends are declared by the board and not guaranteed.
- Mistake: Equating stock price to company intrinsic value — emphasize price reflects supply/demand and expectations.
- Hint: If unsure whether a company pays dividends, check the 'Historical Data' or 'Dividends' section on Yahoo Finance or the company's IR page.

## Grading / Rubric
Total: 5 points
- 2 points: Clear, accurate one-sentence definition (mentions ownership or claim on company)
- 2 points: Correct identification of two shareholder rights (dividend, voting, residual claim) — partial credit for nuanced answers
- 1 point: Correct dividend status and a credible source link (or correct "No" if company doesn't pay)

Feedback examples:
- "Good definition; try to mention 'ownership' explicitly for full credit."
- "Correct rights identified; include a source link for the dividend claim next time."

## Instructor notes
- Accept local-language phrasing as long as core concepts (ownership, rights) are present.
- For advanced learners: ask them to compute market cap and compare with sector peers.

End of solutions.
