# Solutions Notes â€” Phase0/Lesson2

Snapshot date: 2025-10-24

Purpose: Explain how learners should use the example solutions and templates in this folder.

- `watchlist_example.md` contains model answers and formatting suggestions for the 5-point checklist.
- Encourage learners to copy entries into their personal `watchlist.md` and adapt numbers with live quotes.
- Instructor note: When reviewing submissions, check for completeness (5 checklist items), dated entries, and a clear personal risk rule.

Assessment guidance (self-check):
- Full credit: All 5 checklist items present, dated, with at least one source link and a clear risk rule.
- Partial credit: Missing small items (e.g., 3y CAGR) but clear reasoning.
- Feedback tips: Encourage habit formation (timestamping rules), ask for one concrete action next time.
