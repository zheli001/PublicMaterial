# Exercise: Investment Mindset & Risk Awareness

Snapshot date: 2025-10-24

Objective: Practice writing a personal risk rule and apply the 5-point checklist to two tickers.

Instructions
1. Open `watchlist.md` (use `solutions/watchlist_sample.md` as a template if needed).
2. Add two tickers of your choice to the watchlist (e.g., one ETF and one stock).
3. For each ticker, perform a dated evaluation using the 5-point checklist:
   - Business model (1 line)
   - Revenue growth (1y / 3y CAGR)
   - Profitability (net margin or operating margin)
   - Valuation (TTM P/E or proxy)
   - Catalyst / Risk (one key catalyst and one main risk)
4. For each evaluation, include one explicit personal risk rule (e.g., "Max 5% per position; do not sell without checking 3 fundamentals").
5. Save your entries with a timestamp and source links (Yahoo Finance or company filings preferred).

Deliverable
- Two dated evaluation entries in `Phase0/Lesson2/solutions/watchlist_example.md` or your personal `watchlist.md` (copy into the lesson folder for submission).
- Model answers / self-check: `./solutions/solution.md` â€” use this file to compare your entries and run the grading/self-check rubric.
- Optional: Post one evaluation to the course forum for peer feedback.

Submission
- Upload or paste the evaluation into the course forum thread titled "Lesson2 Evaluations" or submit via the provided LMS link.

Grading / self-check
- Check that each evaluation includes all 5 checklist items and a clear risk rule.
- Ensure entries are dated and include at least one source link per ticker.
