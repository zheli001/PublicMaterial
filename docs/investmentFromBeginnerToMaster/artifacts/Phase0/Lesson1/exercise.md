# Lesson 1 — Exercises (offline)

Purpose: short, focused activities that reinforce this lesson's key points (course structure, learning path, resources). Complete these by yourself; reference answers are available in `exercise/solutions/solution.md`.

Instructions
- Save your answers in a Markdown file in this lesson folder (for example `exercise_answers.md`) if you want to keep a record.
- No submission system is required for the offline course; use the solution file to self-check.

Exercises

1) Quick recall (2–3 min)
- Question: How many phases are in this course, and what is the approximate duration of each lesson? (short answer)

2) Personal anchor (10–15 min)
- Task: Write 3 SMART learning goals related to this course. For each goal, include one metric you will use to measure progress and one file name where you will record evidence (e.g., `watchlist.md`, `portfolio.md`).

3) Outcome checklist (5–10 min)
- Task: From this lesson, pick 3 concrete things you expect to be able to do after completing the course (e.g., create a 6-week study plan). For each, write a short action you will take to practice it.

Notes
- These tasks are intentionally lightweight and practical so offline viewers can do them immediately after watching the video.
- Use `solutions/solution.md` to self-check after you complete the exercises.

Enjoy the course — the solutions file is next to this file in `solutions/`.
