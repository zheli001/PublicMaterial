# Portfolio (sample) — $1,000 paper portfolio

Snapshot date: 2025-10-24
Owner: Jeff Li

Initial assumptions
- Total starting capital: $1,000
- Allocation: 60% ETFs ($600), 40% Stocks ($400)
- Example snapshot prices (illustrative):
  - VTI: $235.00
  - VOO: $440.00
  - BND: $70.00
  - JPM: $160.00
  - KO: $62.00

Target allocations and share calculations

- VTI (30% of portfolio = $300)
  - Price: $235.00
  - Target $: $300.00
  - Shares (fractional allowed): 300 / 235.00 = 1.28 shares
  - Executed value: 1.28 * 235.00 = $300.80

- VOO (20% = $200)
  - Price: $440.00
  - Shares: 200 / 440.00 = 0.45 shares
  - Executed value: 0.45 * 440.00 = $198.00

- BND (10% = $100)
  - Price: $70.00
  - Shares: 100 / 70.00 = 1.43 shares
  - Executed value: 1.43 * 70.00 = $100.10

- JPM (24% = $240)
  - Price: $160.00
  - Shares: 240 / 160.00 = 1.50 shares
  - Executed value: 1.50 * 160.00 = $240.00

- KO (16% = $160)
  - Price: $62.00
  - Shares: 160 / 62.00 = 2.58 shares
  - Executed value: 2.58 * 62.00 = $159.96

Initial portfolio summary
- Total executed value (sum of executed values) = $998.86
- Remainder cash (unallocated due to rounding) = $1.14

Simulated month-1 returns (example scenario)
- Simulated monthly price movement (example):
  - VTI: +3.00% → new price = 235.00 * 1.03 = $242.05
  - VOO: +2.50% → new price = 440.00 * 1.025 = $451.00
  - BND: -0.20% → new price = 70.00 * 0.998 = $69.86
  - JPM: +1.00% → new price = 160.00 * 1.01 = $161.60
  - KO: +0.50% → new price = 62.00 * 1.005 = $62.31

Holdings value after month-1
- VTI: 1.28 * $242.05 = $309.50
- VOO: 0.45 * $451.00 = $202.95
- BND: 1.43 * $69.86 = $99.89
- JPM: 1.50 * $161.60 = $242.40
- KO: 2.58 * $62.31 = $160.74
- Cash buffer: $1.14

Total portfolio value after month-1 = $1,015.62
- Simulated month-1 return = (1,015.62 - 998.86) / 998.86 ≈ 1.67%

Notes
- If your broker does not support fractional shares, round down executed shares and track leftover cash as a cash buffer.
- When reporting, show both target allocation % and actual executed allocation (post-rounding).
- Keep a small cash buffer for commission/fees if applicable.
