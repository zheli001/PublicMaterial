2) Personal anchor (concrete SMART goals + example watchlist)

Below are concrete model SMART goals and a sample watchlist of 10 tickers with a short 5-point checklist evaluation for each. Use this as a template — adapt tickers, timelines, and metrics to your context.

Model SMART goals

- Goal 1 — Watchlist & weekly evaluation
  - Specific: Maintain `watchlist.md` with 10 tickers; evaluate 3 candidates per week using a 5-point checklist (business model, revenue trend, profitability, valuation, catalyst).
  - Measurable: Record dated evaluation entries; target 24 evaluations in 8 weeks.
  - Achievable: 3 evaluations/week with 2–3 hours/week of effort.
  - Relevant: Builds stock-selection skills taught in the course.
  - Time-bound: Reach 24 evaluations by week 8.
  - Evidence file: `watchlist.md` (in lesson folder or your notes folder)

- Goal 2 — Paper portfolio & allocation
  - Specific: Create `portfolio.md` with $1,000 allocation: 60% ETFs (broad equity & bond), 40% individual stocks (2–3 names). Record simulated monthly returns for 2 months.
  - Measurable: Allocation table + monthly returns recorded.
  - Time-bound: Portfolio set up by week 4.

- Goal 3 — Financial mini-reports
  - Specific: For 5 companies, compute P/E and 1-year revenue growth and write a 1-paragraph note for each in `financials_report.md`.
  - Measurable: 5 mini-reports completed in 5 weeks.

Sample 10-ticker watchlist (example tickers)
- AAPL (Apple Inc.)
- MSFT (Microsoft Corp.)
- AMZN (Amazon.com Inc.)
- NVDA (NVIDIA Corp.)
- TSLA (Tesla Inc.)
- VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)
- VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF)
- BND (Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF)
- JPM (JPMorgan Chase & Co.)
- KO (Coca-Cola Co.)

5-point checklist (numeric & concrete fields)
1. Business model: Short description (1 line).
2. Revenue growth: 1-year % and 3-year CAGR % (e.g., 1y +12%, 3y +18%).
3. Profitability: Latest operating margin or net margin % (e.g., net margin 22%).
4. Valuation: Trailing P/E (or P/E range) and simple comment (e.g., P/E 28 -> premium).
5. Catalyst / Risk: Key catalyst (earnings, product launch) and top 1 risk.

Notes on numeric checklist
- Use public financial sources (company reports, financial portals) for numbers; these are illustrative — treat as examples not live quotes.
- Recording exact numeric values helps compare and prioritize candidates.

5) Outcome checklist (example) & sample deliverable files
Below are example outcomes and three sample deliverable files located in the `solutions/` folder. Use them as templates to compare with your own work.

- Outcome: Can create a 6-week study plan
  - Practice: Draft `study_plan.md` with weekly milestones and time estimates.
  - See sample: `solutions/study_plan.md` (sample schedule with milestones).

- Outcome: Can compute basic P/E and revenue growth
  - Practice: Use `financials_report.md` to compute metrics for 5 companies.
  - See sample: `solutions/financials_report.md` (5 mini-reports with numbers).

- Outcome: Can set up a paper portfolio
  - Practice: Create `portfolio.md` and simulate monthly returns.
  - See sample: `solutions/portfolio.md` (sample allocation and simulated returns).

Notes
- These are suggested model answers — learners should adapt details (tickers, timelines) to personal circumstances.
- Use the `solutions/solution.md` and the sample files in `solutions/` as concise references to self-check after completing `exercise.md`.
