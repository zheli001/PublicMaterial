This 6-week study plan is a sample schedule learners can adapt. Each week expects ~3–4 hours of study and one practical exercise (watchlist evaluation or portfolio update).

| Week | Focus | Activities | Deliverable |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Course orientation & basic concepts | Read lesson 1, review slides, create `watchlist.md` with 10 tickers, write 3 SMART goals | `watchlist.md` (initial), `study_plan.md` draft |
| 2 | Basic metrics & valuation | Learn P/E, revenue growth; practice on 3 watchlist tickers; start `financials_report.md` | 3 mini-reports in `financials_report.md` |
| 3 | Asset allocation & paper portfolio | Build `portfolio.md` with $1,000 sample allocation; allocate ETFs vs stocks | `portfolio.md` with allocations and share calculations |
| 4 | Monitoring & rebalancing basics | Simulate month 1 returns, record in `portfolio.md`; evaluate 3 more tickers | `portfolio.md` month-1 update; 3 watchlist evaluations |
| 5 | Risk & diversification | Review bond exposure, correlation basics; adjust allocation if needed | `portfolio.md` rebalancing note; updated `watchlist.md` |
| 6 | Review & next steps | Produce a 1-page summary of learnings; plan next 6-week cycle | `summary.md` + updated templates |

Tips
- Spend 30–45 mins per evaluation: 5‑point checklist + quick notes.
- Keep sources (links) in each evaluation entry.
- Use the templates in `solutions/` folder as a starting point.
