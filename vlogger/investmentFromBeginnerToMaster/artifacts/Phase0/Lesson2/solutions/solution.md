# Solutions & Instructor Notes — Phase0 / Lesson2

Snapshot: 2025-10-24
Owner: Jeff Li

Purpose: model answers, instructor hints, and a simple rubric for the in-video exercise and the `watchlist.md` five-point evaluation.

---

## 1) Short model answers (exercise prompts)

Prompt: Write one personal risk rule and perform a five-point evaluation for one ticker.

Model answer (short):
- Rule: "I will not allocate more than 5% of portfolio value to a single speculative position; for core positions (宽基 ETF) target 40–70% allocation depending on risk profile."
- Five-point evaluation (example for SPY):
  1. Timeframe: Long-term (5+ years)
  2. Fundamentals: Broad-market ETF (S&P 500) — diversified by construction
  3. Risk: Short-term volatility (e.g., macro shocks), low likelihood of permanent capital impairment for the broad market
  4. Action: Maintain core allocation; no change unless personal liquidity or investment hypothesis changes
  5. Notes: Record news items and planned re-check date (e.g., 2026-04-01)

## 2) Example watchlist entries (copyable)

Example 1 — conservative (ETF core):
- Date: 2025-10-24
- Ticker: SPY
- Rule (personal): I will not have more than 5% of portfolio in any single non-core position. Core (SPY/VTI) may be 50%.
- 5-point evaluation:
  1) Timeframe: 5 years (core)
  2) Fundamentals: Width of S&P 500 (diversified), low-cost fund
  3) Risk: Market drawdowns expected; no company-specific failure risk
  4) Action: Hold; add on drawdown only if cash permits and time horizon unchanged
  5) Notes: Track macro headlines; next review 2026-04-01

Example 2 — speculative (single stock):
- Date: 2025-10-24
- Ticker: AAPL
- Rule (personal): I will not allocate more than 3% of total portfolio to this single-stock position.
- 5-point evaluation:
  1) Timeframe: 2 years (trade/idea window)
  2) Fundamentals: Strong cash flow, product cycle risk remains
  3) Risk: Company/product execution risk; short-term sentiment-driven volatility
  4) Action: Trim to maintain <=3% if position grows; sell if fundamental thesis (product/market) is proven false
  5) Notes: Record catalyst dates; next review 2026-01-01

## 3) Common mistakes (and instructor hints)
- Mistake: Treating short-term volatility as permanent risk.
  - Hint: Ask: has the investment's fundamental thesis changed? If not, consider holding.
- Mistake: Overconcentration in a single name because of recent winners.
  - Hint: Use position-sizing rules and rebalance at regular intervals.
- Mistake: Blindly applying tight stop-losses without an exit thesis.
  - Hint: Write a clear 'failure condition' (what would invalidate the thesis) and use that to drive exits.

## 4) Instructor cues and suggested probing questions
- "What is your investment horizon for this ticker?"
- "What would need to change for you to sell?"
- "How much of your portfolio are you comfortable losing before you would change your plan?"

## 5) Grading / Self-check rubric (simple)
- Complete (3 pts): Student submitted a dated watchlist entry with ticker, explicit rule, and 5-point evaluation filled.
- Quality (2 pts): The evaluation shows reasonable alignment between timeframe, fundamentals, and action (no contradictions).
- Reflection (1 pt): Student noted at least one concrete mitigation action or re-check date.

Score guidance:
- 6 points: Excellent — clear rule, consistent evaluation, concrete next steps
- 4–5 points: Good — mostly complete; some room for clarifying action or timeframe
- 0–3 points: Needs improvement — missing core elements or inconsistent reasoning

## 6) Instructor-ready sample feedback (copyable)
- "Good — you specified a clear timeframe and an action consistent with your rule; consider adding a planned re-check date to make it executable."
- "Your rule is reasonable, but check that the allocation fits your overall portfolio and cash needs — consider lowering for speculative positions."
