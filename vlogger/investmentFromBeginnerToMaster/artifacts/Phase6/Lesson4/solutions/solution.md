# Solutions — Phase6 / Lesson4: Reflection & Next Step

This file provides model reflections, a grading rubric, a concise student template to copy, and instructor guidance for reviewing student submissions.

## Model reflection examples

Good example (5 lines, strong):
- "Most important lesson: discipline of process — a clear checklist (entry, stop, size, review) reduced my emotional trading and improved my execution consistency."
- "Action: I will adopt a weekly 30-minute review and maintain a trading journal with a 1-line lesson per trade."
- "Impact: Expect to reduce impulsive entries by 50% over the next month and improve risk control."
- "Next step: automate daily P&L export and create a dashboard to track key metrics."
- "Support needed: peer feedback on my weekly journal for the first month."

Concise example (2–3 lines, acceptable):
- "I learned that position sizing and stops determine long-term survival; I will limit single-position risk to 1% and use ATR-based stops."
- "Next: implement size calculator and run it on next 10 trade ideas."

Poor example (not sufficient):
- "I learned a lot and will trade better."  
  - (Why poor: vague, no concrete action, no measurable next step.)

## Student one-page template (copy & paste)

Use this template to submit your reflection. Keep it short (3–6 lines).

- Lesson summary: <one-sentence summary of the most important takeaway>
- Concrete action: <one concrete change you will make next week>
- Expected outcome: <one measurable result you expect>
- Support needed (optional): <anything you want from instructors/peers>

Example:
- Lesson summary: Discipline of process reduced my impulsive trading.
- Concrete action: I will record a 1-line lesson after every trade and do a weekly 30-min review.
- Expected outcome: Reduce impulsive entries by 50% in 4 weeks.
- Support needed: Peer review of weekly journal entries.

## Grading rubric (5 points total)

- Clarity of lesson summary (2 pts)
  - 2: Clear, actionable summary of a specific lesson.
  - 1: Vague but related to course topics.
  - 0: No lesson or unrelated.

- Concrete action & feasibility (2 pts)
  - 2: Specific, measurable action (who/what/when/how).
  - 1: General action without measurable detail.
  - 0: No action or unrealistic plan.

- Evidence of reflection / expected outcome (1 pt)
  - 1: Provides a measurable expected outcome or a clear follow-up step.
  - 0: No expected outcome or follow-up.

Scoring guidance: assign whole points only. Provide a 1–2 sentence comment when students score ≤3 to guide improvement.

## Instructor guidance on feedback tone and examples

- Be concise and constructive. Praise specific good choices (e.g., "good to see you adopt ATR stops") and offer one concrete improvement suggestion when needed.
- When a submission is too vague, ask a clarifying question rather than marking it wrong (e.g., "What's one measurable result you expect from this change?").
- Encourage measurable goals. If a student promises a change but lacks metrics, request they add a KPI (e.g., reduce average position size to X% or keep max daily loss to Y).
- If a submission demonstrates behavioral insight (e.g., recognizing emotional triggers), prioritize supporting actions over technical fixes.

Suggested feedback phrases:
- "Nice: specific action — weekly review. Suggestion: add one measurable KPI to track progress."
- "Good insight on stop discipline — can you specify the stop rule (ATR multiple or percent)?"
- "Thanks — helpful reflection; please set a target date for completing your dashboard."

## Administrative notes

- Expected submission filename: `exercise_answer.md` in the lesson folder or via the LMS submission form.
- Recommend instructors batch-grade with the rubric, then post a short summary of common themes and a few exemplary reflections (with student permission).
