# Solutions — Phase4 / Lesson5: Event Analysis

Model answer (example):
- Event chosen: Company XYZ Q3 Earnings (2025-10-20) — reported revenue down 8% YoY and guidance lowered.
- Immediate trading implication: Expect elevated intraday volatility and potential gap down at open; short-term traders may reduce exposure or apply tighter stops.
- Longer-term investment implication: If guidance downgrade is due to structural demand weakness (not one-off items), consider revisiting valuation and downgrade target price; otherwise, treat as a potential buy-on-weakness opportunity with caution.

Rubric (5 points total):
- Immediate implication: 2 points (clear trading action or risk statement)
- Longer-term implication: 2 points (assessment of structural vs one-off causes)
- Use of evidence / clarity: 1 point

Example submission (model):
- Immediate: "Expect gap down; avoid initiating new long positions and set stop-loss at 3% for existing positions." (2 pts)
- Long-term: "Revenue decline tied to lost key contract—structural concern; lower target and monitor next quarter for recovery." (2 pts)
- Evidence: references to guidance note and revenue breakdown. (1 pt)

Instructor notes:
- Encourage concise answers; the goal is clarity under time pressure.
- For ambiguous cases, award partial credit when the student lists reasonable follow-up checks (e.g., read management commentary, check cash flow, or compare to peers).
- Watch for answers that confuse short-term noise with structural signals; require at least one piece of evidence or a follow-up action.
