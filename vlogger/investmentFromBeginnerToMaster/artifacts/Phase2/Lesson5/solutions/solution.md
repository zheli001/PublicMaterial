# Solutions â€” Phase2 / Lesson5: Position Sizing Calculation

Model calculation example:
- Account size: $10,000; Risk per trade: 1% -> Risk amount = $100.
- Stop-loss distance 5% -> position size = Risk amount / (entry price * 5%) -> if entry price = $20, shares = 100 / (20*0.05) = 100.

Scoring: correctness and explanation.
